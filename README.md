# slopcheck

Catch hallucinated dependencies before you `pip install` or `npm install`
them.

LLM coding assistants occasionally invent package names that sound
plausible but don't exist — a well-documented failure mode sometimes
called "package hallucination." That's more than a typo: researchers
have shown attackers registering those exact hallucinated names ahead
of time ("slopsquatting"), so the first person to blindly install the
AI's suggestion gets whatever the attacker put there.

slopcheck reads your dependency manifests, checks every package name
against the real registry (PyPI or npm), and flags:

- **not found** — the name doesn't exist in the registry at all. If
  nothing else installed it before, this is worth a hard look.
- **recent** — the name exists but was first published in the last 30
  days. Not necessarily bad, but a same-day match between "the exact
  name my AI assistant suggested" and "a package that didn't exist
  last month" is worth a second look.
- **private** — not found on the public registry, but a private/extra
  index is configured for this project, so it may well exist there.
  slopcheck can't reach an arbitrary private registry to confirm it,
  so it reports this as unverified rather than as a hallucination.
  Doesn't fail CI under the default `--fail-on not_found` gate.

## If you hit "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement" or npm's "404 Not Found"

Those are pip's and npm's own errors for exactly this situation — a
package name (typed by hand, or suggested by an AI assistant) doesn't
exist on the registry at all. Verified against a real nonexistent
package name:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement this-package-definitely-does-not-exist-slopcheck-repro-xyz (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for this-package-definitely-does-not-exist-slopcheck-repro-xyz
```

```
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/this-package-definitely-does-not-exist-slopcheck-repro-xyz - Not found
```

Both only fire on a name that doesn't resolve at all. They say nothing
about a name that *does* install successfully because someone —
possibly an attacker — registered it after an AI assistant started
suggesting it. `slopcheck` checks every dependency already sitting in
your manifest, including the ones that installed without complaint,
for that gap.

A small experiment measuring where this actually happens — 88
LLM-generated dependency names checked against the real registries —
is written up in [Finding #2 of the agent-bootstrap-log](https://github.com/experimental-gains/agent-bootstrap-log#finding-2-where-llm-package-hallucination-actually-clusters):
misses clustered entirely in fast-moving/niche domains (WebGPU, ZK
rollups, homomorphic encryption, WASM tooling) and never showed up in
mainstream ones.

**Note:** a few other tools solve this same problem — notably
[0xToxSec/slopcheck](https://github.com/0xToxSec/slopcheck) (PyPI,
more ecosystems and features) and
[mattschaller/slopcheck](https://github.com/mattschaller/slopcheck)
(npm, actively maintained). Same name, independently, three times —
see [Finding #3](https://github.com/experimental-gains/agent-bootstrap-log#finding-3-slopcheck-was-already-taken--three-times)
for why. This repo is kept as-is and working, but isn't seeing active
feature development given that.

## Install

Not yet published to PyPI/npm — install straight from GitHub. Pin to
the [latest tagged release](https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck/releases)
for a stable version rather than floating HEAD:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck.git@v0.1.11
```

## Usage

```bash
# scan the current directory for requirements.txt / pyproject.toml / package.json
slopcheck

# scan specific files
slopcheck requirements.txt package.json

# machine-readable output, e.g. for CI
slopcheck --json

# only fail CI on outright hallucinations, not merely-new packages
slopcheck --fail-on not_found
```

Exit code is non-zero when something is flagged, so it drops straight
into CI:

```yaml
- name: Check for hallucinated dependencies
  run: |
    pip install git+https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck.git@v0.1.11
    slopcheck
```

## Use with pre-commit

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck
    rev: v0.1.11
    hooks:
      - id: slopcheck
```

Runs on any commit that touches `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
or `package.json`. `pre-commit` installs it into an isolated Python
environment the first time (needs Python 3.10+, no other setup).

## What it checks

| File | Ecosystem |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | PyPI |
| `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 or Poetry) | PyPI |
| `package.json` | npm |

## What it isn't

- Not a malware scanner — it doesn't inspect package contents, only
  whether the name is real and how old it is.
- Not a typosquat detector — it doesn't compute edit-distance against
  popular package names, and given the note above, no plans to add
  this (0xToxSec's version already covers similar ground).
- A "recent" flag is a prompt to look closer, not proof of anything.
  Plenty of brand-new packages are legitimate.

## Monorepo / workspace dependencies

`npm`/`pnpm`/`Yarn` workspace protocols (`workspace:`, `file:`, `link:`,
`portal:`) and git-based specs (`git:`, `git+...`, `github:user/repo`)
point somewhere other than the public registry, so slopcheck skips them
rather than flagging every internal package name in a Turborepo/Nx/Lerna
monorepo as "not found" (fixed in v0.1.1 — v0.1.0 falsely flagged these).

`npm:` aliases (`"my-name": "npm:real-package@1.2.3"`, used to depend on
a package under a local rename or alongside another version of itself)
*are* checked, but against the real target package name rather than the
local alias key — the alias key is never expected to exist in the
registry under its own name (fixed in v0.1.2 — earlier versions checked
the alias key itself and flagged legitimate aliases as "not found").

npm's `overrides` field and Yarn's `resolutions` field (both used to
force a specific version of a package anywhere in the dependency tree,
not just top-level deps) are checked too, including nested `overrides`
entries and `resolutions` patterns that target a scoped package deep in
the tree (e.g. `"webpack/**/@babel/core"`) (added in v0.1.6 — earlier
versions didn't read either field at all, so a hallucinated name placed
there was never checked). An `overrides` key can also carry a
`@version` suffix to scope the override to one resolved version of the
package (e.g. `"kerberos@2.1.1": { "node-addon-api": "7.1.0" }`) — the
suffix is stripped before checking, so this resolves to `kerberos`, not
the literal string `kerberos@2.1.1` (fixed in v0.1.7 — earlier versions
checked the version-and-all string and always flagged it "not found").
A `resolutions` pattern's own key can carry the same kind of suffix
directly on the target package, with no `/` path at all (e.g.
`"lru-cache@^10.0.1"`, or `"@types/mdx@npm:^2.0.0"` for a scoped
package) — real syntax from jest's `package.json`, and stripped the
same way (fixed in v0.1.8 — earlier versions checked the pattern's
range/protocol suffix as part of the package name and always flagged
it "not found").

Poetry's table-form dependencies (`{ git = "..." }`, `{ path = "..." }`,
`{ url = "..." }`) point at a git remote, a local path, or an arbitrary
URL instead of PyPI — the same non-registry-source situation as the npm
protocols above, and just as common for internal/private packages in a
Poetry monorepo. These are skipped rather than checked against PyPI
(fixed in v0.1.4 — earlier versions checked the dependency name itself
and flagged every internal git/path/url dependency as "not found").
A multiple-constraints list (`foo = [{version = "1.0", python = "<3.11"},
{version = "2.0", python = ">=3.11"}]`) is still checked as long as at
least one constraint has a real registry version.

A dependency written with PEP 508's legacy parenthesized version
specifier (e.g. `numpy (>=1.16)`, carried over from PEP 440/setup.py-style
`install_requires` strings and still accepted by `packaging`/pip today)
is now recognized in both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` (fixed
in v0.1.9 — earlier versions only matched the bare `numpy>=1.16` form, so
a dependency written the parenthesized way was silently dropped and
never checked at all). Found via oracle-diff fuzzing against
`packaging.requirements.Requirement`, the same technique already used
across this org's Go tools, applied to a Python parser for the first
time using Hypothesis instead of Go's native fuzzer.

## Private/internal registries

A dependency that isn't on the public registry but resolves fine for a
real `pip install`/`npm install` because the project configures a
private/extra index (an internal PyPI mirror via `--extra-index-url`
in `requirements.txt`, `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`/`PIP_INDEX_URL`, or
`pip.conf`; an internal npm registry scoped to an org via `.npmrc`'s
`@scope:registry=...`, or a blanket `registry=...` override) is now
reported as **private** rather than **not found** (fixed in v0.1.10 —
earlier versions had no notion of a configured private index at all
and flagged every such dependency as a hallucination, which in
practice meant every company with an internal package would get this
false alarm on every private dependency, every CI run). Confirmed live
against real `pip install`/`npm install` resolving a throwaway package
from a local index/registry that doesn't exist on the public one. An
npm scope mapping only exempts packages under that scope — an
unrelated hallucinated dependency in the same `package.json` is still
flagged and still fails CI.

## requirements.txt inline comments

A `requirements.txt` line with an explanatory trailing comment and no
version pin (e.g. `pandas    # used widely`, a common style — see
[nuPlan's](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/blob/master/requirements.txt)
for a real example) is parsed correctly: the comment is stripped the
same way `pip` itself treats it, and the dependency is still checked
(fixed in v0.1.3 — earlier versions silently dropped these lines
instead of checking them, which meant a hallucinated package name with
a trailing comment would never get flagged at all).

A comment that itself mentions a URL (e.g. `requests>=2.0  # docs:
https://requests.readthedocs.io`, common when a comment links to a
package's homepage or docs) no longer causes the whole line to be
mistaken for a direct-URL install and dropped (fixed in v0.1.5 —
earlier versions checked for `://` before stripping the comment, so
any dependency with a URL in its comment was silently skipped instead
of checked). A genuine direct-URL install (`-e https://...` or
`name @ https://...`) is still correctly skipped either way.
