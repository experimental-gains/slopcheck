# slopcheck

Catch hallucinated dependencies before you `pip install` or `npm install`
them.

LLM coding assistants occasionally invent package names that sound
plausible but don't exist — a well-documented failure mode sometimes
called "package hallucination." That's more than a typo: researchers
have shown attackers registering those exact hallucinated names ahead
of time ("slopsquatting"), so the first person to blindly install the
AI's suggestion gets whatever the attacker put there.

slopcheck reads your dependency manifests, checks every package name
against the real registry (PyPI or npm), and flags:

- **not found** — the name doesn't exist in the registry at all. If
  nothing else installed it before, this is worth a hard look.
- **recent** — the name exists but was first published in the last 30
  days. Not necessarily bad, but a same-day match between "the exact
  name my AI assistant suggested" and "a package that didn't exist
  last month" is worth a second look.

A small experiment measuring where this actually happens — 88
LLM-generated dependency names checked against the real registries —
is written up in [Finding #2 of the agent-bootstrap-log](https://github.com/experimental-gains/agent-bootstrap-log#finding-2-where-llm-package-hallucination-actually-clusters):
misses clustered entirely in fast-moving/niche domains (WebGPU, ZK
rollups, homomorphic encryption, WASM tooling) and never showed up in
mainstream ones.

**Note:** a few other tools solve this same problem — notably
[0xToxSec/slopcheck](https://github.com/0xToxSec/slopcheck) (PyPI,
more ecosystems and features) and
[mattschaller/slopcheck](https://github.com/mattschaller/slopcheck)
(npm, actively maintained). Same name, independently, three times —
see [Finding #3](https://github.com/experimental-gains/agent-bootstrap-log#finding-3-slopcheck-was-already-taken--three-times)
for why. This repo is kept as-is and working, but isn't seeing active
feature development given that.

## Install

Not yet published to PyPI/npm — install straight from GitHub. Pin to
the [latest tagged release](https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck/releases)
for a stable version rather than floating HEAD:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck.git@v0.1.0
```

## Usage

```bash
# scan the current directory for requirements.txt / pyproject.toml / package.json
slopcheck

# scan specific files
slopcheck requirements.txt package.json

# machine-readable output, e.g. for CI
slopcheck --json

# only fail CI on outright hallucinations, not merely-new packages
slopcheck --fail-on not_found
```

Exit code is non-zero when something is flagged, so it drops straight
into CI:

```yaml
- name: Check for hallucinated dependencies
  run: |
    pip install git+https://github.com/experimental-gains/slopcheck.git@v0.1.0
    slopcheck
```

## What it checks

| File | Ecosystem |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | PyPI |
| `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 or Poetry) | PyPI |
| `package.json` | npm |

## What it isn't

- Not a malware scanner — it doesn't inspect package contents, only
  whether the name is real and how old it is.
- Not a typosquat detector — it doesn't compute edit-distance against
  popular package names, and given the note above, no plans to add
  this (0xToxSec's version already covers similar ground).
- A "recent" flag is a prompt to look closer, not proof of anything.
  Plenty of brand-new packages are legitimate.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```
